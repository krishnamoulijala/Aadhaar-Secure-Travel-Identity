# Aadhaar-Secure-Travel-Identity
This system is used to create a tool that manages the handling of passport and license using the unique identification associated with each individual.   The application deals with allowing the citizens to register for a unique identity.  The ID is supported with a pin.  Citizen’s being issued passport or those have a passport is then associated with the UID.  This helps the citizen to travel abroad without having the passport. The UID will provide access to the passport from the airport for the airline from the centralized server.  The details and profile of the citizen with the photo can be viewed as part of security check. The crime department can also use the application to trace or stop any person from travelling abroad. The airline gets a notification when the airport staff has access to the citizen’s passport.
